Title: Exploring the Water Phase Diagram

Note: This document if for introductory thermodymnics studnets to help them understand the phase diagram. It assumes knowledge of the phases of matter, as well as the importance of the phase diagram in thermodynamics.

Body: Fluids consists of all matter in its liquid or gaseous state. These states are typically used for energy conversions, particularly for harnesing electricity in powerplants. It is important to understand the relationship between these phases, both for increasing the efficiency and reliability of energy-producing powerpoints. Above, you can see a graph of the temperature and entropy of water. The dome shown separates the liquid (right of the dome), gaseous (left of the dome), and vapor (under dome) phases of water.

The boxes on the left represent a specific entropy at a certain pressure (and consequently, a specific temperature). Take note of the steapness of the slope on the left and right part of the dome. Note that since the steam goes from has to liquid, entropy decreases from 10 to 0.

Click the boxes to see the isothermal (constant temperature) lines as water increases in entropy. These lines show the how the pressure changes in relation to entropy when temperature is held constant. Take note that the line becomes horizontal (gradient of 0) inside the dome, but a non-zero gradient outside. Why do you think that is?

Now view the same dome, but shown with teemperature on the y axis. Here, notice that the dome is much wider, since entropy has a stronger relationship with temperature than pressure.

Many students mistakenly think that these graphs are "incredibly similar", indicating the the differences are not substantial or important to learn. To demonstrate why this is important, take the following question, common in a thermodynamics senario:

Steam enters a heat exchanger, at the temperature, entropy, and pressure indicated by the box. Heat is removed from the fluid at a constant pressure until it is a compressed liquid (right side of the dome). Draw the isobar (constant pressure line) to show the change in temperature as the fluid decreases in entropy.

After drawing the line, press show isotherm to see the result. Did you get it right? If you were believe the graphs are "incredibly similar," most likely your line was drawn in the opposite direction. Or maybe, since the know entropy increases as temperature increases, you drew a negative-sloped line or curve. While this relationship is true, the slope is still 0 while within the dome. Why do you think that is?

Shown here is the pressure, temperature, and entropy mapped onto a 3D surface. Parts in pink are gases, blue are liquids, and red are vapors. Observe the constant temperature line (orange) and constant pressure line (green). Now click on the buttons to rotate between the temperature-entropy graph and the pressure-entropy graph. Do you see why this creates the interesting shapes shown on the previous 2D graphs?

Physically, what is happening is that during phase change (i.e., under the vapor dome) the temperature and pressure stay constant. However, by viewing the full 3D structure, it is easier to see how a straight line from one view can be transformed in a different view.
